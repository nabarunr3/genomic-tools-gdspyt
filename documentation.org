#+title:A set of sequence manipulation code
* Reading from a Given FASTA file
(1) How many records are in the file? A record in a FASTA file is defined as a single-line header, followed by lines of sequence data. The header line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column. The word following the ">" symbol is the identifier of the sequence, and the rest of the line is an optional description of the entry. There should be no space between the ">" and the first letter of the identifier. 

Separate functions for the following tasks are to be written:
1. Accepting a FASTA file as input from the command line [other arguments if necessary will be accepted later by modifying this code]
2. Reading from a FASTA file and putting sequences into a dictionary
3. Using the dictionary to count and return the number of sequences

* Comparing sequences in the file
(2) What are the lengths of the sequences in the file? What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence? Is there more than one longest or shortest sequence? What are their identifiers? 

The way to go about this is:
- Find the length of each seqeunce in the dictionary and put this in another dictionary with keys as the identifiers and values as the length. Use this dictionary for comparison.
- Now, find the longest and shortest sequence and print their identifiers and lengths.
