The following are answers to the questions have been arrived to from the following [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics/discussions/all/threads/b-DTkFHjEeaZaBIe_mhavQ][thread]] on Coursera.

Here are the results I get when I run my program on the example file:

Record count: 25

Longest sequence: 4805

Shortest sequence: 512

----

longest ORF in reading frame 1 = 1686

start index of this ORF is 2824

seq_id of this ORF is gi|142022655|gb|EQ086233.1|323

----

longest ORF in reading frame 2 = 1371

start index of this ORF is 65

seq_id of this ORF is gi|142022655|gb|EQ086233.1|323

----

longest ORF in reading frame 3 = 1608

start index of this ORF is 141

seq_id of this ORF is gi|142022655|gb|EQ086233.1|294

----

For sequence: gi|142022655|gb|EQ086233.1|43,

longest ORF is in reading frame 3 with length = 213

----

First instance of most frequently occuring repeat of size 7 is gccgccg

Repeat gccgccg occurs a total of 56 times in the input FASTA file.

----

Size 11 repeats that occur with the highest frequency occur 3 times.  These sequences are:

gcgcgcgcggc

tgctcgtgctc

gctcgtgctcg

----

The sequence GCGGCCG occurs a total of 56 in the data file
