#+title: Python for Genomic Data Science 

This contains code as part of the [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics/home/welcome][Python for Genomic Data Science]] course on Coursera.

We aim to achieve 3 things here: 
1. Parse a FASTA file. 
2. Study the ORFs in the sequences of the file and find the longest ORF. 
3. Map some repeat sequences in the sequence reads.
