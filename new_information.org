1. ORF cannot overlap. So start from the occurance of a start codon and ignore all the start codons in between till a stop codon is reached. 

Hello Michael,

That I can do. If you search for repeats of length 10, there is only one (GCGCGGCGCG) repeated max times (8).

To add a little more sense to it, if you were, for example, looking for repeats of length 10 appearing max-1 times, you'd find 4 different repeats ('GCCGGCCGGC': 7, 'CGGCGGCCGG': 7, 'CGGCGTCGCG': 7, 'CGCGGCGCGG': 7)

I hope this helps, please ask if you'd like me to give you more info on these or anything else.

Best,

Dejan
